# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
In this analysis we were given the task of presenting ride share info in a way that shows how
different city types have different fares and number of rides. The three tpyes of environments analyzed were rural, urban and suburban. Before analyzing the data, its safe to say Urban will have a higher number of rides, and possibly higher fares. We will see if this is true..


Below you see a preview of the data we are working with. Although only Urban is shown, there are two other types of environment being analayzed.
