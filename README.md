# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
In this analysis we were given the task of presenting ride share info in a way that shows how
different city types have different fares, number of rides and number of drivers. The three tpyes of environments analyzed were rural, urban and suburban. Before analyzing the data, its safe to say Urban will have a higher number of rides drivers, and possibly higher fares. We will see if this is true..


Below you see a preview of the data we are working with. Although only Urban is shown, there are two other types of environment being analayzed.

### Results
The results of this analysis were as suspected. The Urban city type had the highest total fares in the months that were analyzed. In second Suburban and third rural. Without having any data to work with, one would assume that this would be true. More rides are given in urban that rural. This analysis shows just that.

Below you will see the final result of the analysis, proving Urban ranks first in highest total of fares in the months analyzed.

##### Summary
In summary, the data confirmed what most would already assume was the truth. That truth being that in any given urban environment is going to have a higher final fare than a rural environment. Yes, rural customers pay more, but the quantity of rides given is just too high to be anywhere near the total of rural fares.
